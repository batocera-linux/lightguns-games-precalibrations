=== Light gun games precalibrations ===
To do.

Main points :
1. Working arcade games (Atomiswave, Naomi, model2, model3, MAME standalone) precalibrated
2. To add : more arcade precalibration (mame2003plus, lr-mame, fbneo)
3. Future precalibration for home consoles with save feature (Dreamcast, PSX, Saturn, etc.)
4. Optimizing arcade games (mainly .cfg files)
